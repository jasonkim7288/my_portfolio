# Purpose
Gmail application will manage your Gmail account, show the email list after logged in, show the content of each email, and also let you create a new email with an file attachment. All those functions can be done with a simple command-line interface (CLI).<br />
Users can access their Gmail accounts and check the email without any browser and even send a simple email with a file attached. It will be a good idea to use this Gmail application if you are a computer server manager which has only command line UNIX environment or if your browser has been infected by any serious virus so you cannot use it.<br />
Once a simple security setting is changed, it is free to access Gmail anytime on command prompt.<br />

# Features
## Manage Gmail account
Gmail application is able to manage the Gmail account. Once you log in with your existing Gmail account, the application automatically store the account name into a file and show the account name list after next log-in.<br />
If the account you logged in is not supposed to be stored, there is a command for deleting the account which is just removing the account name from the local file not removing the real Gmail account from the server.<br /> 

# Sitemap
Once Gmail application succeeds in log-in, it will display the current account name logged in, the current label of the mailbox, an email list, and the current page of the mailbox.<br />
Every label is from Gmail server, so you can see the exact same label from browser, and default label of the mailbox is "INBOX". Each labeled mailbox has an email list showing email number, sender, subject and a little bit of body.<br />
You can navigate each label of the mailbox and the pages if there are more than 7 mails in the mailbox. If there is an email that interests you, "View the mail" will display the detailed content.<br />

# Screenshots
On the mail list screen, there is an option for creating a new email that allow you to send a simple email to anyone.<br />
Once whom to send, and what the subject is have been submitted, message body part can be written with a html format. You can still use only text except writing "\<br />" to make a new line ('Enter' key is not working).<br />
There is also a special function that "File attachment" is available if wanted. The file name has to include exact file path.

## User experience
This Gmail program uses IMAP(Internet Message Access Protocol), so it will be much slower than the original Gmail app using [Google's official Gmail API Ruby Client](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/ruby).
