Once Gmail application succeeds in log-in, it will display the current account name logged in, the current label of the mailbox, an email list, and the current page of the mailbox.<br />
Every label is from Gmail server, so you can see the exact same label from browser, and default label of the mailbox is "INBOX". Each labeled mailbox has an email list showing email number, sender, subject and a little bit of body.<br />
You can navigate each label of the mailbox and the pages if there are more than 7 mails in the mailbox. If there is an email that interests you, "View the mail" will display the detailed content.<br />

# Screenshots
On the mail list screen, there is an option for creating a new email that allow you to send a simple email to anyone.<br />
Once whom to send, and what the subject is have been submitted, message body part can be written with a html format. You can still use only text except writing "\<br />" to make a new line ('Enter' key is not working).<br />
There is also a special function that "File attachment" is available if wanted. The file name has to include exact file path.
